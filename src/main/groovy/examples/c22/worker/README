When the system is executed on a network of processing nodes 
we have to run each node process in a script that initially 
creates the network channels and then invokes the required 
process.  

 The best order for running the processes is 
1) RunEmitter, 
2) RunCollector and then 
3) as many RunWorker processes as the number of workers required.
