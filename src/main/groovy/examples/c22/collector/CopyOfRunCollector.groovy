/*
 * RunCollector creates port 3000 on its node.  The nodeï¿½s IP address 
 * is then printed as this will be needed to inform the Base nodes.  
 * The any2one channel fromWorkers is created as a net2one channel 
 * because this is the reading end of the channel.  
 * Note that it uses the CodeLoadingChannelFilter.FilterRX() (line 27) structuring 
 * mechanism.  The unaltered Collector process is then invoked.  The 
 * number of workers specified in in the script RunEmitter must be the 
 * same as that specified in RunCollector.
